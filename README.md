# Flipkark-dataset
This project is a Python-based data analysis of Flipkart mobile phone listings. The dataset contains details such as mobile names, brands, ratings, reviews, prices (MSP & MRP), discounts, and product features. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Features

Load and explore Flipkart mobile dataset (622 entries, 9 columns).

Display product details (Name, Brand, Ratings, Reviews, Prices, Discount, Features).

Perform descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, etc.).

Visualize data using charts (ratings distribution, discount trends, brand comparisons).

Identify top-rated and most reviewed smartphones.

Explore pricing trends (MSP vs. MRP).

Clean and preprocess dataset for insights.
